# Português Puro Language Server

The VS Code extension recognizes Português Puro source files with the `.pop`
extension. The workspace configures `windows1252` for the `portugues-puro`
language ID in `.vscode/settings.json`; the extension also contributes this
language-specific default.

## Functionality

- Go to Definition for declared types, including multi-word names and
  declarations in other open `.pop` documents, as well as both the base type
  and pointed-to type in pointer declarations.
- Each open document's symbol table is refreshed when the document opens,
  changes, or is saved, and discarded when it closes.
- Initial parser and type symbol table in `server/src/typeParser.ts`, recognizing
  dot-terminated type declarations, including `ponteiro para um tipo`,
  structures with named fields, and the primitive type names `byte`/`bytes`
  and `estrutura`/`estruturas`. `número` is a declared structure type, not a
  primitive.
- Scalar declarations can use integer multipliers (for example,
  `Uma dezena são 10 unidades.`). Type lookup accepts generated plural names,
  and scalar types store their reduced scale as a fraction relative to the
  declared type `número`.
- Type names are case-insensitive for lookup, and runs of whitespace (including
  line breaks and tabs) are normalized.
- End-to-end coverage for Go to Definition.

## Development

- Run `npm install` in this folder to install the client and server dependencies.
- Open this folder in VS Code and press Ctrl+Shift+B to compile in watch mode.
- Press F5 and open a `.pop` file in the Extension Development Host to test the
  language server.
- Run `npm test` to compile and execute the VS Code end-to-end tests against
  this workspace, including the language-specific encoding setting.
